# Kafka Connect for Backup & Restore

kafka-connect-backup-restore is a Kafka Connector for doing backup and restore of Kafka Topics to Amazon S3. This is a joint effort of Swiss Post and Trivadis.

Documentation for this connector can be found [here](docs/README.md).

## Development

To build a development version you'll need a recent version of Kafka as well as a set of upstream Confluent projects, which you'll have to build from their appropriate snapshot branch. See the [FAQ](docs/faq.md) for guidance on this process.

You can build kafka-connect-backup-restore with Maven using the standard lifecycle phases.
